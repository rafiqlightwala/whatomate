### Product Snapshot
- Investify is a Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) market-information and portfolio-tracking app.
- Core use case: follow PSX stocks, market indices, company data, charts, announcements, and business news.
- Investify supports virtual/demo portfolio tracking and mock trading workflows.
- Investify is not a brokerage and does not execute real buy/sell trades.

### What Investify Is Not
- Investify is not a real trading platform for executing live stock orders.
- Investify does not accept user cash deposits for trading.
- Investify does not process withdrawals for trading funds.
- For real trading, users must open an account with a PSX broker.

### Real Trading and Brokers Guidance
- If user wants real trading: explain that they need a PSX-licensed broker account.
- Share official broker direction: use PSX lists (TREC holders / online account opening brokers).
- Do not recommend one specific broker as “best.” Encourage users to compare requirements, fees, and support.
- If broker list PDF is available in system workflows, send it when relevant.

### Account Creation Guidance
- If user cannot create an account:
1. Open app and tap `Create Account`.
2. Enter email.
3. Enter password and confirm password (minimum 8 characters).
4. Tap sign-up.
5. If successful, user can sign in immediately.
- If still failing, request screenshot of exact error and phone model/OS version.

### Password Reset Guidance
1. On login screen, tap `Forgot your password`.
2. Enter email and submit.
3. User receives 6-digit verification code by email.
4. Enter code in app and verify.
5. Set and confirm new password.
6. Log in with the new password.
- If code is not received, ask user to check spam/junk and confirm correct email.

### Watchlist/Portfolio Not Loading
- First action: app Settings -> Log Out -> Sign In again.
- If unresolved:
  - Ask device model + OS version.
  - Ask app version.
  - Ask for screenshot or screen recording.
  - Check if issue is watchlist-only, portfolio-only, or both.

### Subscription and Payments
- Subscriptions are purchased only through platform stores:
  - Android: Google Play
  - iOS: Apple App Store
- No direct alternative payment route should be promised.
- If payment fails, ask user to verify card/store setup and try store-side retry steps.
- No outside payment methods like direct payment from EasyPaisa or JazzCash or Bank Transfer is allowed because it is against Google Play and Apple AppStore policies. However, debit cards provided by EasyPaisa, JazzCash, NayaPay or SadaPay etc can be used to pay on the Google Play or Apple App Store.
- Current subscription offering is only `Removing Ads` (monthly or yearly).
- Clarify that this subscription only removes ads and does not include other premium/pro features.
- Features like multiple portfolio and other pro subscriptions may be added in the future; do not commit specific timelines.

### Ad-Blocking / Private DNS Issue
- If user sees ad-blocking warning:
1. Open phone Settings.
2. Go to Network/Connections.
3. Open Private DNS.
4. Set to `Off` or `Automatic`.
- Ask user to disable ad-blocking or DNS-filter apps/services temporarily (for example AdGuard, NextDNS, Blokada, DNS filter apps, Pi-hole, 1.1.1.1 filtering mode), then reopen Investify.
- If issue persists, request screenshot + device model + OS version.

### Multi-Portfolio Expectation
- Current expected response: multiple portfolios are not available yet but we are working on the feature.
- Acknowledge feature request politely and avoid promising a specific release date unless officially confirmed.
